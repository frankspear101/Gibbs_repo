	Subroutine ParallelToTangent(logFileOn)
!	routine to find composition of the phase where the tangent plane is parallel to the system tangent plane
!	That is find F = (Âµ(j)-Âµ(1)) - (ÂµOnTan(j)-ÂµOnTan(1)) = 0
!	where Âµ(j)-Âµ(1) is the tangent to the Gibbs surface for the phase and
!	ÂµOnTan(j)-ÂµOnTan(1) is the slope of the system tangent in the same composition direction
!
!	We want the Xj where they are equal
!
!	Using Newton's method we set up a system of equations of the form
!
!	Fj(Xo) + d(Fj(atXo))/dXj*Xj = 0
!
!	there is one equation for each independent composition variable (Xj).
!	All necessary values and derivatives are computed in subroutine dlnAdX ( taken from dudTPX)
!	
!	After a call to dlnAdX, we have for each phase component (even dependent ones)
!	lnAct(jj) = (jj)/R*T		(for ideal solutions)
!	duTPX(jj,2+j) = d/dXj where the derivatives are only for each independent phase component (there are numPhCo terms and numPhCo-1 derivatives)
!		(the first to array elements are the T and P derivatives of each  but we don't need those here so we don't calculate them)
!
!	So our equations are calculated as
!	F(Xoj) = (uo(j)-uo(1)) + R*T*(lnAct(j) - lnAct(1)) - (ÂµOnTan(j)-ÂµOnTan(1))
!	d(FXoj)/dXj = dudTPX(j,2+j) - dudTPX(1,2+j)
!
!	so our matrix is
!	d(F2Xo)/dX2 + d(F2Xo)/dX3 + d(F2Xo)/dX4 + ...   * X2 = -F2(Xo)
!	d(F3Xo)/dX2 + d(F3Xo)/dX3 + d(F3Xo)/dX4 + ...   * X3 = -F3(Xo)
!	d(F4Xo)/dX2 + d(F4Xo)/dX3 + d(F4Xo)/dX4 + ...   * X4 = -F4(Xo)
!
!	which we solve for Xj . then compute
!	Xnewj = Xoj + Xj
!	and repeat until we converge
!
!	The compositions of each phase at the minimum are stored in phCoatGMin(noPh,numPhCo)
!	The G of the phase is stored in gOfPhase(k)

!	If a phase displays a solvus, there are situations where there is no solution to the parallel tangent
!	This occurs because the equation to solve is a cubic and there are either 1 or 3 roots. 
!		When there is only 1 root there is no solution for the other phase
!		Two examples are muscovite-paragonite and alkali feldspars
!	We need to be able to identify these situations and stop trying to find a root
!	We will do this by examining the slope to the equations
!		F(Xoj) = (uo(j)-uo(1)) + R*T*(lnAct(j) - lnAct(1)) - (ÂµOnTan(j)-ÂµOnTan(1))
!		d(FXoj)/dXj = dudTPX(j,2+j) - dudTPX(1,2+j)
!	If the slope changes sign (eg negative to positive) and the function does not change sign, then
!		we don't have a root (remember we're trying to find the composition where the function = 0)
!		if the function is never zero we can't have a root.
!	I suppose there are situations where this algorithm won't work and we'll probably need to look at the matrix of second derivatives
!		to determine if it's positive or negative definite... etc.
!		For example, this might only work on a binary.
!	A more robust solution might be to find the minimum and maximum of the function and see if the function has different signs at these points.
!		That would ensure that there was a root.
